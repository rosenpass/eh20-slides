# Introducing Rosenpass

## Intro slide

## This is Rosenpass

## YOU WILL LEARN THAT

* most cryptography we use today is susceptible against attacks from quantum computers
* the key difference about pre- and post-quantum cryptography is not about the underlying math, its about the function interface used

## Post Quantum Security

* Pre-quantum Cryptography
* Post-quantum Cryptograpy
* Hybrid Cryptography

## Kems and Nikes

* Explain Nikes
* Explain Kems

## YOU WILL LEARN

* How protocols are built using KEMs and NIKEs
* That – for the most part – protocol primitives can be exchanged for other onse

## Building a Protocol with Nikes

* Noise-IK

## Building a Protocol with Kems

* Initiator-Auth
* Responder-Auth
* Forward Secrecy

## YOU WILL LEARN

* How – instead of changing protocols – protocol primitives are combined to imbue the protocol with more security overall
* Ways to build hybrid combiners

## GHP Combiner

## X-Wing

## WireGuard and Rosenpass

## YOU WILL LEARN

* Where to find out more about Rosenpass in detail
